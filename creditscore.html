<h3>6 Ways to Help Build Your Credit</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nLa5TtJGyhA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>


<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Pay your bills on time: Payment history is one of the most important factors in determining your credit score. Make sure to pay all of your bills on time, including credit cards, loans, and utilities. Late payments can have a negative impact on your credit score.</p>

<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Keep your credit card balances low: Your credit utilization ratio is the amount of credit you're using compared to your credit limit. A high ratio can negatively impact your credit score. To keep your credit utilization low, try to keep your credit card balances below 30% of your credit limit.</p>

<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Don't apply for too much credit at once: Applying for too much credit at once can make it seem like you're in financial trouble and can negatively impact your credit score. Limit your credit applications to when you need them, and don't apply for multiple credit cards or loans at the same time.</p>

<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Monitor your credit report: Check your credit report regularly to make sure there are no errors or inaccuracies. If you notice any issues, report them to the credit reporting agencies immediately.</p>

<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Consider a secured credit card: If you have a limited credit history or a low credit score, a secured credit card can be a good option. With a secured credit card, you'll need to make a deposit that serves as collateral for your credit limit.</p>

<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Become an authorized user: If you have a family member or friend with good credit, ask if they can add you as an authorized user on their credit card. As an authorized user, you'll be able to build credit without being responsible for the payments. However, make sure the primary cardholder is responsible for their credit and doesn't have a history of missed payments or high balances.</p>
